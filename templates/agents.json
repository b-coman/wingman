A signal means something we want to look for in further investigations, and based on them to select questions that we'll ask in our discovery sessions. The confidence score has a value from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates very high confidence. Confidence score and will help to prioritize the signal's relevance in selecting questions to be asked in future investigations.
